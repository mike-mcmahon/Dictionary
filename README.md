# Dictionary
As an assignment for my algorithms and data structures course, I wrote an algorithm that would read in a text file that would produce an 
ascending sorted list of unique words with a count of each words occurance.  The algorithm made use of both a hash table (Java HashMap)
and a Red-Black tree (Java TreeMap).  Additionally, I created a user interface to facilitate easy file selection and save by using the
Eclipse SWT Toolkit SDK.

As an aside, I have implented this in C# using the Dictionary and SortedDictionary classes contained in the System.Generics namespace.
